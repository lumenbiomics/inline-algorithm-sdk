Pramana Inline Algorithm SDK documentation
==========================================

This package is a simple way to prepare your inline algorithms for running inline with Pramana's
scanner. It will help to take the complexity out of creating your own API server and ensure that all
required endpoints are called correctly.

        If you prefer to use a different programming language, or just want more control over your code,
        feel free to refer to the API documentation to see all the required API endpoints and requests.
        There are two sections:
        
        1. The APIs defining the communication from the scanner to the algorithm -
        `Scanner to Algorithm API calls
        <https://developers.pramana.ai/inline-algorithms/documentation#tag/Scanner-to-Algorithm-API-calls>`_
        
        2. The APIs defining the communication from the algorithm to the scanner -
        `Algorithm to Scanner API calls
        <https://developers.pramana.ai/inline-algorithms/documentation#tag/Algorithm-to-Scanner-API-calls>`_
