Pramana Inline Algorithm SDK documentation
==========================================

This package is a simple way to prepare your inline algorithms for running inline with Pramana's
scanner. It will help to take the complexity out of creating your own API server and ensure that all
required endpoints are called correctly.

If you prefer to use a different programming language, or just want more control over your code,
feel free to refer to this `API documentation
<https://developers.pramana.ai/inline-algorithms/documentation>`_  to see all the required API
endpoints.
