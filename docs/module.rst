        If you prefer to use a different programming language, or just want more control over your code,
        feel free to refer to the API documentation to see all the required API endpoints and requests.
        There are two sections:

        1. The APIs defining the communication from the scanner to the algorithm -
        `Scanner to Algorithm API calls
        <https://developers.pramana.ai/inline-algorithms/documentation#tag/Scanner-to-Algorithm-API-calls>`_

        2. The APIs defining the communication from the algorithm to the scanner -
        `Algorithm to Scanner API calls
        <https://developers.pramana.ai/inline-algorithms/documentation#tag/Algorithm-to-Scanner-API-calls>`_
